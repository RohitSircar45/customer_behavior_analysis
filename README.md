Data Analytics End-to-End Project
Overview

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data analytics workflow — transforming raw data into actionable business insights and a professional executive presentation.

The objective was to analyze customer shopping behavior using Python, SQL, and Power BI, and to communicate meaningful insights through a structured report and presentation.

This project showcases technical proficiency in data cleaning, database querying, visualization, and business-focused analysis.

Dataset

Domain: Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis

Format: CSV

Size: 3,900 rows

Columns: 18 data columns

The dataset contains transactional and customer-related information used to analyze purchasing patterns, trends, and performance metrics.

Data preprocessing was required due to:

Missing values

Duplicate records

Inconsistent formatting

Data type corrections

Tools & Technologies

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) — Data loading, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis

PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server — Database storage and SQL analysis

Power BI — Interactive dashboard creation

Gamma — Professional presentation design

Microsoft PowerPoint — Executive-ready slide export
